How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it made it a lot easier

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Say you make a mistake, you can go back to the prior version.  Also you can save
    your work as you go after each working bit of code, so if you break something you
    can go back to the prior version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I like having the control to commit a logical piece of work.  The downside is
    my computer crashes, I could lose some work and have to redo it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Saving multiple files allow you to keep changes that relate to different files together
    This makes it easier to see the changes in multiple files versus one file at a time

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use the conbination git log, git diff to find what has been changed between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always revert to prior version where things were working and trace through
    to find where the bug was introduced

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For my projects
